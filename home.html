                			The pandemic has had a huge impact on everyone's lives and, for better or for worse, most people have experienced huge lifestyle changes. While I was at home in the countryside I tried out a whole bunch of new things and different ways of exercising without my equipment or gyms. My mum would get cross at me for baking more goodies than we could eat and so I started giving them away to friends and family. It was a hit! I also started training with my mum and the rest of my family and soon even the dog would join in our morning pilates sessions. And so the concept of the yoga cafe was born. A space where people of all ages an abilities can come and enjoy baked goods or stretch their legs before or after a hard days' working in front of a screen. It is easy to fall into an unhealthy lifestyle when working from home. My goal is to motivate others to find their healthy lifestyle routine and stick with it. There is no need to deny yourself that slice of cake or that breakfast muffin. Mental health and physical health come hand in hand.
